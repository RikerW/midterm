    "This is a classification attempt on a very unoriginal dataset (for the midterm, I mean), the wine dataset from UCI, used via the sklearn databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is composed of 13 features; Alcohol, Malic acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, and Proline. They are not measured on any uniform scale. The samples are in 3 classes, so this is a classification problem on those features. It has no missing values and has been cleaned up already.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a very simple ANN with one hidden layer, and used hyperparameter tuning to decide the number of nodes in that layer. The input layer was obviously based on the input dimension & the output the number of classes, so they were not tuned. I used a Hyperband tuner to do this, with the normal epoch/factor of 100/3. After that search, I fit the model on the training data (randomly selected as 75% of the dataset) over 300 epochs, validated with the remaining 25% test data from the dataset, and then plotted the accuracy/loss & confusion matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "The precision of the model seems to be pretty great, the recall is pretty solid, and the f1-score is quite solid overall. The accuracy is good as well. Overall, very few issues in the predictions on the test set, so this model is probably not overfit. The accuracy vs. val accuracy was around 99% vs. 97%, so that's better obviously but really not a huge difference. All in all, I think the model is well fit."
